# AppliedMachineLearning
We used machine learning techniques such as regression, decision tree, and neural networks to predict and compare price prediction models of used cars - Neural Network was the best model. We were able to determine certain features unique to make and model of the car (such as wheel system and horsepower). With the user inputting additional information like mileage, we were able to output an accurate price of the car based on these features.
